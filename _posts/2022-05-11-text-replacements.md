One of my favourite features in the Apple ecosystem is text replacement. It allows you to automatically replace custom strings with predefined text and is useful in multiple scenarios – not the least of which being that it makes the use of typographic details more convenient. Text Replacements are synchronised via iCloud between your Apple devices, making workflows easy.

See below for my own Text Replacements and copy what you find useful.

### Preventing Replacements
In rare cases you don’t want your text to be replaced. To prevent a replacement from happening on macOS, press esc before pressing the space bar or press Cmd+Z immediately after the replacement took place. On iOS click on the x in the text suggestion bubble or three-finger-swipe to undo immediately after the replacement took place.
