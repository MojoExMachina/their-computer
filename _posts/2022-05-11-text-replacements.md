One of my favorite features in the Apple ecosystem is text replacement. It allows you to automatically replace custom text with predefined text and is useful in multiple scenarios. Replacements are synchronized between Mac and iOS devices, making workflows easy.

See below a list of my own text replacements. Please copy them to your heart’s content.
Replace | With | Note
---|---|---
-> | → | 
:alt | ⌥ | Mac option key; good for explaining shortcuts
:caps | ⇪ | Caps key; good for explaining shortcuts
:cmd | ⌘ | Mac Command key; good for explaining shortcuts
:control | ⌘ | Mac Control key ;good for explaining shortcuts
:ctrl | ⌃ | Mac Control key ;good for explaining shortcuts

In rare cases you don’t want your text to be replaced. To prevent a replacement from happening on macOS, press esc before pressing the space bar. On iOS click on the x in the text suggestion bubble.
