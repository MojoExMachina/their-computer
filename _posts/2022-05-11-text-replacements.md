One of my favorite features in the Apple ecosystem is text replacement. It allows you to automatically replace custom strings with predefined text and is useful in multiple scenarios – not the least of which being that it makes typographic details more convenient. Replacements are synchronized between Mac and iOS devices, making workflows easy.

See below my own text replacements. Please copy them to your heart’s content.

### Typographic Details

| Replace… | With… | *Note* |
|-------|--------|:---------|
| -> | → |  |
| <- | ← |  |
| :bullet | • |  |
| :mid | · | Midpoint; a versatile typographic element |
| :prime | ′ | Prime; used as abbreviation for *minutes* |
| :dprime | ″ | Double prime; used as abbreviation for *inches* or *seconds* |
| :degree *and* oo | ° | I don't use this glyph too often, but the additional shorthand is handy when I do |
| :numero | № |  |
| <3 | ♥ |  |
| @@ | email@address.tld |  |
| m^2 | m² |  |
| CO2 | CO₂ |  |
| Ios *and* ios *and* IOS | iOS |  |
| macos | macOS |  |

### Keyboard symbols

### Numbers and Math operators

|-------|--------|:---------|
| ^2 | ² |  |
| 1/2 | ½ |  |
| 1/3 | ⅓ |  |
| 1/4 | ¼ |  |
| 1/8 | ⅛ |  |
| 2/3 | ⅔ |  |

| :multi *and* xx | × | Multiplication sign; I use this often, so I also have a shorthand |
| =/= | ≠ | Not equal |
| <= | ≤ | Greater than or equal |
| >= | ≥ | Smaller than or equal |

### Preventing Replacements
In rare cases you don’t want your text to be replaced. To prevent a replacement from happening on macOS, press esc before pressing the space bar or press Cmd+Z immediatly after the replacements took place. On iOS click on the x in the text suggestion bubble or three-fnger-swipe to undo immediatly after the replacement took place.
